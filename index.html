    <p>
      I am currently a Senior Analyst with the Market Access division of <a href="https://twolabs.com/market-access/" target="_blank">Two Labs Pharma Services.</a> For the past 2 years my role has been focused around strategic consulting for pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers, primarily market access, payer strategy, value message development/testing and new product launch planning. I have worked on global projects involving several European and Asian markets, with experience in the migraine, oncology, asthma and immunology disease states.

      I began self-teaching myself to code in Python at the beginning of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic was kicking off. I had taken a few CS courses while at UCSD, but didn't pursue much beyond that until last year. As I delved deeper into the world of computer science my passion for coding grew, and I have since begun learning other skills such as SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Python packages and frameworks such as Django, and the data science packages for analtyics and machine learning.

      Orininally from Trenton, NJ, I grew up in Tracy, CA until heading off for college at UC San Diego in 2012. Since graduating college, I have resided in beautiful, sunny San Diego, currently in the North Park neighborhood.  In fact, my last 2 companies were both originally headquartered out of the San Diego Union Tribune building (seen in the background).
